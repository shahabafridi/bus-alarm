This application will let users to set a location based alarm on their phone that will go off when they get close to the preselected bus stop. We used the Seattle King County bus routes from One Bus Away project database. Many people use public transportation every day and our application can be easily used with the support from GPS and internet already on the Android phones.  Any person who knows route number can use this application and set the alarm for the desired bus stop.<br>
<br>
The idea is very innovative in that it is the first android application to incorporate publicly available bus information and GPS in an innovate bus stop alarm system. This application allows users to take advantage of the publicly available bus data and presents it to the user as an intuitive bus stop alarm application. We think this application is novel because it really emphasizes the advantage of using public transportation. Most people agree that using free time on public transportation will be helpful but so far, there is no way to use that time efficiently.  The main reason is that users still have to watch out for their stops which gets really annoying. There are many uses of this application for many reasons.<br>
<br>
With the Bus Stop Alarm application, a user who is taking the bus to an unfamiliar place, can go with confidence that they will get off at the correct place even if they don't know exactly when the stop is approaching. A user might use the application to do work or read on the bus. Another user might use this application so that they can take a power nap on the bus after a long day at work or school. Using the application allows people to efficiently utilize time on the bus without the constant worry of missing their bus stop destination. The application's uses also span to benefit disabled users, such as the blind. In situations where the user can't see which bus stop approaching, the application can help them know what location they are currently at. This allows for disabled users to not have to solely rely on the bus driver for approaching bus stop information.<br>
<br>
With the Android platform recently becoming very popular, this application will reach a lot of users who are using public transportation. The user interactive design is simple and intuitive so that most users can easily use it for the first time. All the user needs to know is the bus route number, then they can select the destination from the real-time generated map for that specific bus route. The user can even choose stops from preselected major locations or recently selected stops.<br>
<br>
There is much business potential in this application by incorporating suggested business locations (such as restaurants, shopping places, etc) near the locations of bus stop locations. This idea can also be improved by extending the list of major/favorite locations in the application such that the paid business locations/popular favorite stops get to the top of the list.Â <br>
<br>
The application will be further expanded to incorporate different bus route transportation systems throughout the country.<br>
<br>
<b>Great potential benefit for community</b>
<br>
Using the application can even benefit others, by opting to provide location data to the server. The transmitted data can be invaluable in the way that it reveals the real-time traffic information. With more users using the application, many routes will be updated with real-time traffic information which can be really helpful for others commuting. Hence, using the applications not only helps you utilize time efficiently on the bus but also helps others avoid heavy traffic routes.<br>
